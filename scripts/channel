# Channel
# Version 1.0, bash

# The practice of channeling — a person's body being taken over by a spirit for
# the purpose of communication — has been around for millennia. There are
# countless stories of shamen, witch doctors, prophets and others who claim to
# hear voices or receive some supernatural knowledge from the spirit world.
# Channelers, also sometimes known as psychic mediums, often use what are
# called "spirit guides," friendly spirits who give them knowledge and help
# them on their spiritual journeys.

# channel v1.0
# - Run a chatbot that sees only a terminal (program independent)
#   - The chatbot may have multiple personalities. i.e. a Mad-Hatter's Tea-Party
# channel v2.0
# - Give an AGI control of a terminal
