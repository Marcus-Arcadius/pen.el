;; Games are important not only as a form of recreation but as a method of
;; investigation. The intention is to cut away the constraints of rationalism
;; and allow concepts to develop more freely and in a more random manner. The
;; aim is to break traditional thought patterns and create a more original
;; outcome.

;; Time Travelers' Potlatch
;; A game in which two or more players say what gift they would give to
;; another person - this is usually an historical person who played a role
;; in, or had an influence on, the formation of Surrealism.

;; TODO
;; Parallel Collage
;; https://www.zazie.at/Collaborations/ParallelCollage_6er/00_WebPages/ParallelCollageMenu.html
;; This surrealist game requires a minimum of 3 players.
;; Each player gives 2 graphic images and 2 lines of poetic text to the other
;; players. All players then use the images and lines of text (including
;; their own) to construct a collage-image and collage-poem. In the process
;; of construction, a player can modify any item, in any way desired. Until
;; everyone is finished, each person's work is kept hidden. When all images
;; and poems are complete, they are shared among the players, with a
;; comparison of the results.
