;; This surrealist game requires a minimum of 3 players.
;; Each player gives 2 graphic images and 2 lines of poetic text to the other
;; players. All players then use the images and lines of text (including
;; their own) to construct a collage-image and collage-poem. In the process
;; of construction, a player can modify any item, in any way desired. Until
;; everyone is finished, each person's work is kept hidden. When all images
;; and poems are complete, they are shared among the players, with a
;; comparison of the results.
