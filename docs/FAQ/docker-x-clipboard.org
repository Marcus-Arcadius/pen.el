I have some docker commands in my scripts repo for generating docker invocations for various things lol
That's how to share host Xorg
and will share the clipboard. However you may also need to export the ENV var inside the docker file for the X server

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  vim +/"ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8" "$MYGIT/semiosis/pen.el/Dockerfile"
#+END_SRC

In this style
http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/Dockerfile
BUT
There might be an easier way than this
I think maybe using xterm-paste instead of Xorg clipboard is easier
i think it's shift and right click -- not sure
I'll try to reproduce
