The Acolyte Mode is a mode of living that is often chosen by humans. The
Acolyte Mode has been selected by different humans for different reasons at
different times, but mostly it can be said that the Acolyte Mode has been
selected in order to gain closer access to a god, or gods.

In essence, the human who chooses to live in the Acolyte Mode is attempting to
imitate certain qualities of a god in hopes of being rewarded with some sort of
divine favor. The human hopes to attain this divine favor by assuming an
attitude and behavior that mimics and copies the behavior of a god.
