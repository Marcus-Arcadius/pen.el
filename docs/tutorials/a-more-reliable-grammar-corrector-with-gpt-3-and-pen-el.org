#+TITLE: A more reliable grammar corrector with GPT-3 and Pen.el
#+DATE: <2021-08-10>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: gpt openai pen emacs

** Summary
I make a more reliable grammar corrector.

By allowing the prompt to generate one
"Corrected English:" string per paragraph, but
slicing them out at the end, and using a regex
to match a stop pattern, it's able to handle
multiple paragraphs more intelligently and more reliably.

** Explanation
The preprocessor, =pen-s onelineify= reformats
input text to fit after the =Poor Grammar:=
subprompt.

However, when given multiple paragraphs,
despite being onelinerised, GPT-3 tends to
sometimes generate additional =Corrected English:=
subprompt echos. These have to be removed by
the postprocessor, but they are allowed.

** Prompt
