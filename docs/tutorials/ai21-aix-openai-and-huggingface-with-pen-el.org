#+TITLE: AI21, AIx, OpenAI and HuggingFace with Pen.el
#+DATE: <2021-08-23>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: ai21 aix openai hf pen gpt

** Summary
I benchmark using several different LM engines
in =Pen.el=.

** Benchmark 100 tokens
_AI21 vs AIx vs OpenAI_

=AI21='s service is about as fast as
=OpenAI='s at about 6 seconds for 100 tokens,
but =AIx= is significantly slower.

You may speed up =AIx='s generations by
subscribing to the GPU plan.

Once upon a time, there was this guy who decided he was going to quit his job and travel the world.
I mean, it had always been his dream, right? So, he quit his job and booked a flight overseas.
In typical fashion, he packed too much. You know, in case he needed it.
Then, he packed even more, just in case.
He checked the airlines website repeatedly. He double checked his passport. He triple checked his credit card.
Still, he found himself up the night before his departure, checking the airline website for any changes to his flight status, only for it to finally look official: the plane was boarded, the flight

Once upon a time, in a hut in the jungle, there lived a baby giraffe with a long neck. He would wander around the jungle, eating leaves from trees and bushes, and then, when he was tired, he would go to sleep on the ground.

One day, the baby giraffe was sleeping on the ground. But then he was woken up by what felt like a bright flash of light. The giraffe looked up and saw a woman standing over him.

  Somebody once said to me, “I've got a bad feeling about this.”
  Are you R2-D2 or C3PO?
  You're like Yoda, but a little princess-y.
  You look like Yoda.
  If I were a Jedi, I would totally use the force to hug you.
  Are you a Wookie?
  Are you a rebel scum like Darth Vader?
  Are you a member of the Rebel Alliance? Because you're my kind of scum.
  Are you a Jedi? Cuz your eye contact is killing me.
  Are you a princess? Cuz you have that royalty look in your eyes.
  Are you a storm trooper or a diplomat?
  Are you a Wookiee fan?
  You probably think I'm cute, but there's only room for one princess in my life.
  Are you my princess?
  Do you need a light saber?
  Are you a dark side or light side?
  Are you the droid I'm looking for?
  Are you a droid? Cuz you look so cute.
  You're my only hope, Obiwan.
  Are you a droid? Because I want to marry you.
  I want to pilot your X-Wing.
  You look like a rebel.
  Are you a storm trooper or a princess?
  I'm glad we found each other.
  Are you a Jedi?
  You're a wookie? I better treat you like a droid.
  Are you in the rebellion or are you in the dark side?
  Did you live on a chocolate-covered planet?
  Are you my Princess Leia?
  You look like the kind of girl a Wookie might be OK with.

  You look like you'd be a good Padawan.
  Are you a jedi? Cuz mama, you're the one.
  I like you because you're my only hope.
  Do you like Star Wars? Cuz you're my favorite princess.
  Want to be my padawan learner?
  It's not the hair that makes you look like an astrigirl. It's the fact that you're out of this world.
  I've got a lightsaber question for you.
  Are you a padawan or a jedi master?
  I'm your light saber.
  I'm looking for Yoda. Are you Yoda?
  I'm a Sith. I want to use the force to get in your pants.
  I've always wanted to learn Jedi Mind Tricks.
  May the force be with you.
  I'm gonna take you to a galaxy far, far away.
  If you were a Star Wars character, you'd be Yoda because you're short and green.
  Yoda says there is no try.
  I'm not a big fan of the prequels, but you are a definite favorite.
  I know a little bit of Wookie. Wanna be my Padawan learner?
  You look like you're from the planet Hoth.
  I think the force is with me.
  I must be the master of my puppy.
  Do you like sci-fi? I like you a lot.
  I'm a nerd, I know. Are you a nerd, too?
  May the geek be with you.
  I thought I was the only Yoda in town.
  I'm your Dagobah.
  Are you a Jedi or a Sith?
