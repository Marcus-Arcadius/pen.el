* Pen project roadmap
+ Roadmap [8/29]
    - [ ] Generations stored in Datomic
    - https://semiosis.github.io/posts/representing-multiverses-with-datomic/
  - [ ] Prompts stored in Datomic
  - [ ] Prompt discovery
    - http://github.com/semiosis/prompts/blob/master/README.org
    - http://github.com/semiosis/prompts/blob/master/prompt-repositories.txt
  - [ ] Prompt Catalogue
    - http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/pen-prompt-tablist.el
  - [ ] Make use of arbitrarily many git repositories that store prompts
    - Load a repository such as this: https://github.com/semiosis/prompts
  - [ ] Quinification
    - Allow Pen to interface with a dockerized version of itself
      - This way, =pen.el= may be easily turned into a melpa package and installed into people's emacs configs without risk
  - [ ] vim
    - https://github.com/semiosis/pen.vim
  - [ ] =∞-company-mode=
  - [ ] Create prompt-description-mode schema in schemastore
  - [ ] lm-complete (clojure)
  - [ ] semiosis-token
  - [ ] Build your own sNFT marketplace
  - [ ] light-weight pen mode
    - [ ] Uses docker interop
  - [ ] beam-search
    - [ ] https://machinelearningmastery.com/beam-search-decoder-natural-language-processing/
  - [ ] counterfactual parsing
    - [ ] https://generative.ink/posts/parsing-by-counterfactual/
  - [ ] org-brain for Pen.el docker
  - [ ] Real-time completion of tokens with interrupt
  - [ ] PostHuman AI Marketplace
  - [ ] multiversal viewer
  - [ ] semantic search
  - [ ] multiple prompts repos

** Design
+ Completed [ ]
  - [X] Default behaviour of generated functions
    - [X] First argument may be selection
    - [ ]If selection then text is replaced by default
  - [X] Prompt Catalogue tablist prototype
    - http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/pen-prompt-tablist.el
  - [X] Generate functions of composed prompts
  - [ ] Generate prompts from interactive keyboard macros
  - [ ] Prompt development workflow
  - [ ] Prompt catalogue tablist
  - [ ] Search workflow
    - Semantic search for =straight.el=
    - Semantic search for =nixos.el=
    - Semantic concordance for =KJV bible=
