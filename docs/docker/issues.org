If you get this issue:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  docker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: invalid mount
  {Destination::/root/.emacs.d/host/engines Type:bind
  Source:/var/lib/docker/volumes/2746ade69da1ae8ec0858ac226f1fa9cc5d3e0f847d9545ddba0b15a01dc9652/_data
  Options:[rbind]}: mount destination :/root/.emacs.d/host/engines not
  absolute: unknown.
#+END_SRC

Do a docker inspect on the image.
If there is a volume specified, that's wrong.
I need to export and squash the container again.
