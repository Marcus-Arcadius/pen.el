* Instructions for integrating Pen.el into your own emacs config
go through setup.sh, and make sure you have the dependencies
Ensure your current emacs has module support

You can know if your emacs has modele support by running module-file-suffix
If the minibuffer responds with ".so" you're good
If you get nil then you need to compile emacs with module support or find a binary that has module support
You have to install yamlmod (instructions for compiling are inside setup.sh)

evaluate the variable =module-file-suffix= in your M-: repl

Good
You have module support
Just follow instructions for installing the remaining packages in setup.sh
once you've done that, you have 2 more files: init-setup.el and init.el
if you look inside init-setup.el, all it does really is install a bunch of packages into your emacs
all you have to do is install the packages
then in your .spacemacs at the end of the config you have to run the stuff inside init.el
everything inside init.el from require dependencies down to the bottom of the file
has to go into your own emacs configuration
After you've done this, you've got pen integrated into emacs
but you still have to follow the tutorial instructions
