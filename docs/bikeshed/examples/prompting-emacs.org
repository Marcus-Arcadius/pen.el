* Findings surrounding this investigation
Codex indeed is able to regurgitate original source code.

Also, when there is a particularly coherent
generation from a LM, it's often the case that
this is copied from somewhere.

For example, the pick-up-line:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code
  pena -u -i "Have you heard about three laws of Sex? Law 1: " pf-very-witty-pick-up-lines-for-a-topic/1 Sex | jq-list-to-lines
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Have you heard about three laws of Sex? Sex
  Law 1: Sex is like math: you add the bed,
  subtract the clothes, divide the legs and pray
  you dont multiply!
#+END_SRC

This is also the case for software.

This investigation was aimed at investigating
the complete redundancy of original source
code.

Depending on how you use the software, it
certainly appears that the original source
code is obsoleted to some degree.
