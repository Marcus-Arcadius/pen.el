An eisenhower matrix advisory chatbot is definitely possible. One just has to
realise that it's based on a stochastic language model of the past and the
language model must be continually updated to remain useful.  But those
language models are typically based on open domain data and are empirical
rather than anecdotal models. In the future we'll have to fine-tune our
personal language model on specific datasets which are not open-domain.  To
retain your own data and train your own model is to protect your metaphysical
invariant or your (residual self image) to use a term from the matrix.
