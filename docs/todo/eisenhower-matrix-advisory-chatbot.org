An eisenhower matrix advisory chatbot is
definitely possible.

One just has to realise that it's based on a
stochastic LM of the past and the LM must be
continually updated to remain useful.

But those LMs are typically based on open
domain data and are empirical rather than
anecdotal models.

In the future we'll have to fine-tune our
personal LM on specific datasets which are not
open-domain.

To retain your own data and train your own
model is to protect your metaphysical
invariant or your (residual self image) to use
a term from the matrix.
