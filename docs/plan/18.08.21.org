I think it'd be really cool to make libraries
which use Pen.el as the final prompting
interface.

Sounds really inefficient but I think it'll
still be super powerful Then Pen.el can
basically handle all the authentication and
interweaving of prompts and people can use
their fancy languages.

without needing APIs etc.

I'm thinking this because I'd like interop
with prolog for starters but also it'd be
really useful to model particular things in
other languages
